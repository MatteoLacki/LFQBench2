Version: 0.1.0
Author: Matteo Lacki, Ute Diestler, Stefan Tenzer

Description: This package aims at assuring comparability between 
    the outcomes of different pieces of software that quantify peptides and proteins in LC-MS, LC-IM-MS.
    One of the possibilities here is to compare the reproducibility of experimentally
    injected mixtures of proteomes under different ratios.
